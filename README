NAME
    List::Zip - Module to zip lists.

DESCRIPTION
    Provides functionality to zip list structures.

    List::MoreUtils also provides functionality to `mesh' lists. However,
    this implementation differs. If the lists provided have different sizes
    all of the the lists will be truncated to the same size as the smallest
    list.

SYNOPSIS
        use List::Zip qw(zip zip_with);

        my @zipped      = zip([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ]);
        my @unzipped    = zip(@zipped);
        my @zipped_with = zip_with([ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ] => sub { return $_[0] + $_[1] });

FUNCTIONS
    zip - Converts this list by combining corresponding elements from the input
    lists into lists.

        my @zipped = zip([ 1 .. 5 ], [ 6 .. 10 ]);

    The structure of the list returned by zipping the above is:

        ([ 1, 6 ], [ 2, 7 ], [ 3, 8 ], [ 4, 9 ], [ 5, 10 ])


    zip_with - Converts this list by combining corresponding elements from the
    input lists into lists. The given function is applied to each combination of
    the corresponding elements.

        my @zipped = zip_with([ qw(t f r f) ], [ qw(h a e o) ], [ qw(e t d x) ] => sub {
            return join '', @_;
        });

    The structure of the list returned by zipping with the above function
    applied is:

        ('the', 'fat', 'red', 'fox')

EXPORTS
    None by default.
